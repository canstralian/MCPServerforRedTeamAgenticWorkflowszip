# Use Cases

The API is made for customers that have a need to access and interact with their
HackerOne report and program data and be able to automate their workflows. Customers
use this to generate dashboards, automatically escalate reports to their internal systems,
assign users based on the on-call personnel or when an internal ticket is resolved,
interact with the reporters, and more. The public API provides a bi-directional
channel to consume and interact with report and program data.

We have provided a Ruby code example below to show how easy it is to use. The code
example fetches new and triaged reports, sorted by the last time someone from your
program touched it. This example requires the 3rd party gem
[HTTParty](https://rubygems.org/gems/httparty) to be installed:

```
  require 'httparty'

  basic_auth = {
    username: '<YOUR_API_USERNAME>',
    password: '<YOUR_API_TOKEN>',
  }

  query = {
    filter: {
      program: ['john_doe_example_company'],
      state: ['new', 'triaged'],
    },
    sort: 'reports.last_program_activity_at',
  }

  HTTParty.get 'https://api.hackerone.com/v1/reports',
    query: query,
    basic_auth: basic_auth
```

## Importing known vulnerabilities

The API allows you to import known vulnerabilities to your HackerOne program so that you can have central vulnerability management and detect duplicate vulnerabilities. You can use the [create report endpoint](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources#reports-create-report) to systematically import vulnerabilities that are found outside the HackerOne platform, such as from internal tests or via automated vulnerability scanners.

Below is an example on how to import a known vulnerability:

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/reports" \
  -X POST \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @- <<EOD
    {
      "data": {
        "type": "report",
        "attributes": {
          "team_handle": "security",
          "title": "XSS in login form",
          "vulnerability_information": "...",
          "impact": "...",
          "severity_rating": "medium",
          "weakness_id": "1337",
          "structured_scope_id": "287",
          "source": "detectify"
        }
      }
    }
EOD
```

Using the source attribute, you can define the original source of the vulnerability. This will be helpful in tracking vulnerabilities from specific sources and in running analytics by source. The source attribute will also be returned in the response of the [report object](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources#reports-get-report).

## Using the reports query endpoint

The [Get All Reports](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources#reports-get-all-reports) endpoint allows you to get multiple reports at once. The filters enable you to insert criteria the report has to match to show up in the list. The default filter to get all reports in one program is `filter[program]`. Your request would look like:

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/reports?filter[program][]=example" \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"
```

### Combining multiple filters

Using this endpoint, you can combine multiple filters if you want to make the query more specific. Here's an example that queries all reports in the `triaged` state for the `john_doe_example_company` program.

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/reports?filter[program][]=example&filter[state][]=triaged&filter[severity][]=medium" \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"
```

### Combining multiple filter values

This example demonstrates how to select reports for programs with the `example` handle and with `triaged` or `retesting` state.

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/reports?filter[program][]=example&filter[state][]=triaged&filter[state][]=retesting" \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"
```

### Filtering reports by custom fields

This example demonstrates how to select reports for programs with the `example` handle and with custom field values `234`: `value1` and `235`: `value2`, where `234` and `235` are custom field attribute IDs. Custom field attribute IDs can be fetched from the [program endpoint](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources#programs-get-program).

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/reports?filter[program][]=example&filter[custom_fields][][id__eq]=234&filter[custom_fields][][value__eq]=value1&filter[custom_fields][][id__eq]=235&filter[custom_fields][][value__eq]=value2" \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"
```

## Awarding bounties

The API has 2 different methods for awarding bounties: one for vulnerabilities reported via HackerOne and one for vulnerabilities reported outside of the HackerOne platform. For vulnerabilities reported via HackerOne, you can use the [bounty award endpoint](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources#reports-award-bounty):

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/reports/172932/bounties" \
  -X POST \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @- <<EOD
    {
      "data": {
        "message": "Thanks for the great report. Here's your bounty!",
        "amount": "500",
        "bonus_amount": "250"
      }
    }
EOD
```

### External bounties

To award a bounty to someone who found a vulnerability outside the HackerOne platform, use the [program bounty endpoint](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources#programs-award-bounty). In the example below, there's no report of the vulnerability in the HackerOne system.

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/programs/11000/bounties" \
  -X POST \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @- <<EOD
    {
      "data": {
        "type": "bounty",
        "attributes": {
          "amount": 100,
          "reference": "JIRA1239",
          "title": "Reflected XSS on marketing.example.com",
          "recipient": "hacker@hackerone.com",
          "currency": "USD",
          "severity_rating": "high"
        }
      }
    }
EOD
```

## Program management

This section will dive deeper into querying your program information using the API. All endpoints in this section require your program ID. To find your program ID, you can use the following query:

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/me/programs" \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"
```

This endpoint returns all programs and their IDs this API token can access.

### Finding team members and groups

You can use the [read program endpoint](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources#programs-get-program) to get basic information about your program and its members. The endpoint will return team members and groups associated with the program which can be used to easily see all members of a certain user group.

In the example below, we use the program `11000` which is the ID of our example program.

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/programs/11000" \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"
```

### Finding allowed reporters and their activities

You can use the [get allowed reporters endpoint](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources#programs-get-allowed-reporters) to get basic information about the allowed reporters of your private program.

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/programs/11000/allowed_reporters" \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"
```

To see activities of specific allowed reporter of your private program, you can use the [get allowed reporter's activities endpoint](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources#programs-get-allowed-reporter-activities)

Note that, the activity types you can see are "activity-program-hacker-joined", "activity-program-hacker-left" and "activity-invitation-received"

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/programs/11000/allowed_reporters/1337/activities" \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"
```

### Fetching the balance

Most programs have a deposit at HackerOne that can be used for bounty payments.

A program that’s using a credit card, won’t have a balance as bounties are directly charged on the credit card. See our [documentation](https://docs.hackerone.com/organizations/billing.html) for more information about our different payment methods.

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/programs/11000/billing/balance" \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"
```

The balance returned is the total balance available in the program. Both the bounty and bounty fee (if applicable) will be paid from this balance.

### Fetching billing transactions

All financial transactions made in your HackerOne program are accessible via the [transactions endpoint](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources/#programs-get-payment-transactions). This endpoint returns a transaction for each change to your balance. This can be a bounty payment, deposit, move of funds, etc.

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/programs/11000/billing/transactions?month=9&year=2019" \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"
```

Billing transactions are only available for programs that are in private or public mode. If the program is still in the sandboxed mode, this endpoint will return a `403` response.

### Checking if a hacker is participating in your program

Programs that are in private mode can only be accessed by hackers that are invited to the program. To confirm if a hacker is invited and has access, you can query the hacker by using the [show user endpoint](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources#users-get-user). In the example below, we’re querying the user `fransrosen`:

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/users/fransrosen" \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"
```

The API will respond with some basic user information and a list of private programs (`participating_programs`) the user has access to. Note that you won’t be able to see private programs you can’t access yourself.

### Managing policy

Some companies have their policy page stored in a central git repository for better change management. With the [policy endpoint](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources#programs-update-policy), you can easily keep your policy page in HackerOne up to date based on the changes you’re making externally.

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/programs/11000/policy" \
  -X PUT \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @- <<EOD
    {
      "data": {
        "type": "program-policy",
        "attributes": {
          "policy": "..."
        }
      }
    }
EOD
```

Changing the policy text will automatically notify hackers that are subscribed to the program about the policy change.

### Adding attachments to the policy

If you have any files that are relevant for hackers, for example an APK file with a special version of your app, you can easily upload these to the policy page using the [policy attachments endpoint](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources#programs-upload-policy-attachment). This endpoint enables you to upload any file to the policy and use the policy endpoint to include it in the policy.

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/programs/3774/policy_attachments" \
  -X POST \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>" \
  -F "file=@/tmp/example.png"
EOD
```

The API will respond with an ID that can be included as `{ID}` in the policy of the program using the [policy endpoint](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources#programs-update-policy).

## Assets management

All asset endpoints require your organization's `{ID}`. You can use the below endpoint to get that.

### Get your organization ID

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/me/organizations" \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"
```

### Importing existing assets

The API allows you to import assets into the HackerOne platform and detect duplicates.
Below is an example of how to import assets:

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/organizations/10/asset_imports" \
  -X POST \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>" \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -d @- <<EOD
{
  "file": "string"
}
EOD
```

#### CSV file

The endpoint accepts a CSV file. Supported CSV format consists of the following columns:

- identifier

  - Must be a valid identifier for the selected asset type.
- asset\_type

  - One of: `Domain`, `Url`, `Cidr`, `Hardware`, `SourceCode`, `IosAppStore`, `IosTestflight`, `IosIpa`, `AndroidPlayStore`, `AndroidApk`, `WindowsMicrosoftStore`, `Executable`, `OtherAsset`
  - Note: When choosing between `Domain` and `Url`, we recommend going with `Domain`. `Domain` type assets are fine-grained enough for most purposes, `Url` type assets should only be used when different `Url`s on the same Domain are representing significantly different infrastructure.
- technologies
- confidentiality\_requirement

  - One of `none`, `low`, `high`
- integrity\_requirement

  - One of `none`, `low`, `high`
- availability\_requirement

  - One of `none`, `low`, `high`
- description
- reference

Column headers are required.

File example:

```
identifier;asset_type;technologies;confidentiality_requirement;integrity_requirement;availability_requirement;description;reference
hackerone.com;Domain;technology1,technology2,technology3;high;medium;low;"Asset1 description";ref1
192.168.1.1/32;Cidr;technology4,technology5,technology6;medium;low;high;"Asset2 description";ref2
com.hackerone.example;IosAppStore;technology1,technology2,technology3;low;high;medium;"Asset3 description";ref3
com.hackerone.example;AndroidPlayStore;technology7,technology8,technology9;high;low;medium;"Asset4 description";ref4
```

This request will return an [asset import](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-reference#asset-import) object. Processing of an asset import
happens asynchronously, you can check the status by
[retrieving the assets import](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources#assets-retrieve-an-assets-import) using the asset import ID returned.

### Attaching screenshots to an asset

You can upload screenshots to attach to an asset using this endpoint.

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/organizations/10/asset_screenshots" \
  -X POST \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>" \
  -d @- <<EOD
{
  "file": "paprika.png",
  "asset_id": 12
}
EOD
```

## Organization management

### Get your organization ID

All organization management endpoints require your organization's `{ID}`. You can use the below endpoint to get that.

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/me/organizations" \
  -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"
```

### Add a member to your organization

An new organization member can be invited to an organization with `{ID}` using the endpoint to
[create an invitation](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources/#organizations-create-an-invitation) and the invitee email.

```

## Automatic inbox assignment

Through a combination of webhooks and api calls, reports can automatically be routed to specific custom inboxes based on any report attribute.

### Permissions

In order to be able to assign reports submitted to a program, to a specific custom inbox, the API token needs to have at least the following permissions:

- Report permission on the program
- Read only permission on the custom inbox

Now we’ll need some pieces of information, namely the organization ID, and ID’s of the custom inboxes we’ll be using.

### Finding our Organization ID

We can use the [get your organizations](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources/#organizations-get-your-organizations) API call to find our Organization ID:

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/me/organizations" \
 -X GET \
 -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>" \
 -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

Which returns something like:

```
{
 "data": [\
   {\
     "id": "13", # <-- This is the organization ID we are looking for.\
     "type": "organization",\
     "attributes": {\
       "handle": "example",\
       "created_at": "2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",\
       "updated_at": "2023-03-07T09:19:46.377Z"\
     }\
   }\
 ]
}
```

### Finding our Custom Inboxes

Now we need to find the ID’s of the custom inboxes we want to assign reports to using the [get all inboxes](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources/#organizations-get-all-inboxes)

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/organizations/13/inboxes" \
 -X GET \
 -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>" \
 -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

Which will return something like:

```
{
 "data": [\
   {\
     "id": "13",\
     "type": "inbox",\
     "attributes": {\
       "name": "Example program inbox",\
       "type": "default" # <-- Note that reports cannot be assigned or unassigned from default inboxes\
     }\
   },\
   {\
     "id": "65", # <-- This is an ID we’re interested in\
     "type": "inbox",\
     "attributes": {\
       "name": "Example custom inbox for asset A",\
       "type": "custom"\
     }\
   },\
   {\
     "id": "67", # <-- This is an ID we’re interested in\
     "type": "inbox",\
     "attributes": {\
       "name": "Example custom inbox for asset B",\
       "type": "custom"\
     }\
   }\
 ]
}
```

Note: Only inboxes which have "type": "custom" in their attributes can have reports assigned to them.

If you are not seeing the custom inbox you are looking for in this list, ensure that the api token has at least Read Only permission on that custom inbox.

### Determining inbox mapping.

Now we need to create some mapping of a report attribute to a Custom Inbox ID. In this example, we’ll use the asset identifier of a structured scope. This mapping will be stored in your own API service, and will be referred to when a new report comes in.

```
[\
 {\
   "example.com": "65",\
   "example.co.uk": "65",\
   "example.nl": "67"\
 }\
]
```

### Triggering the service when a report comes in

In order for the service to know when a report comes in, we need to [set up a webhook on hackerone.com](https://docs.hackerone.com/en/articles/8588351-webhooks). Set this webhook to trigger on the "Report created" event.

### Retrieving the relevant information

when that webhook is triggered, the body will contain a payload that includes the report ID. We can then [fetch the report](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources/#reports-get-report) through the API, and find the structured\_scope information we’re looking for.

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/reports/292" \
 -X GET \
 -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>" \
 -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

Which returns (abbreviated for legibility)

```
"data": {
  "id": "292",
  "type": "report",
  # [.. abbrev ..]
  "relationships": {
    # [.. abbrev ..]
    "structured_scope": {
      "data": {
        "id": "4",
        "type": "structured-scope",
        "attributes": {
          "asset_type": "URL",
          "asset_identifier": "example.nl", # <-- The asset identifier
          "eligible_for_bounty": true,
          # [.. abbrev ..]
        }
      }
    },
    # [.. abbrev ..]
  }
}
```

If you get any 4xx error on this request, ensure the API token has "Report" permission on the program inbox the report is in.

### Updating the custom inboxes

Looking at our mapping, we see that "example.nl" should be routed to inbox "67". In order to achieve this, we can use the [update inboxes](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources/#reports-update-inboxes) endpoint:

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/reports/292/inboxes" \
 -X POST \
 -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>" \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 -H 'Accept: application/json' \
 -d @- <<EOD
{
 "data": {
   "organization_inbox_ids": ["67"]
 }
}
EOD
```

The report will now show up in "Example custom inbox for asset B", as well as the default inbox it was submitted to.

If you get any 4xx error on this request, ensure that the API token has at least "Report" permission on the program inbox the report is in.

## Program analytics

The analytics API empowers you to retrieve program analytics data with the help of predefined queries. You can query time-series data to analyze trends or retrieve cross-sectional data to investigate the state of your program.

The charts and tables on the analytics dashboards utilize these same queries. If you can see data on an analytics dashboard, you can retrieve that same data through the API. For the list of all supported queries, please see the [analytics endpoint documentation](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources/#analytics).

The following examples are meant to demonstrate a few of the many wonderful things you could do with the analytics API.

### Reports submitted per quarter

For this example let us assume that you want to get a count of the number of reports submitted during each quarter over the last year; similar to what you see on the Submissions chart in the Analytics dashboard. Let us also assume that the current date is December 5th 2024 and that the program we want to retrieve information for has an id of 5.

You could extract this information by making the following request:

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/analytics/?key=submissions&start_at=2023-12-05&end_at=2024-12-05&interval=quarter&team_id=5" \
 -X GET \
 -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>" \
 -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

Which would return an [analytics object](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources#analytics) like this:

```
{
  "data": [\
    {\
      "keys": [\
        "count",\
        "interval"\
      ],\
      "values": [\
        [\
          "128", # Q4 2023 submissions count, not including records before start_at\
          "2023-10-01 00:00:00 UTC"\
        ],\
        [\
          "256", # Q1 2024 submissions count\
          "2024-01-01 00:00:00 UTC"\
        ],\
        [\
          "256", # Q2 2024 submissions count\
          "2024-04-01 00:00:00 UTC"\
        ],\
        [\
          "512", # Q3 2024 submissions count\
          "2024-07-01 00:00:00 UTC"\
        ],\
        [\
          "1024", # Q4 2024 submissions count, not including records after end_at\
          "2024-10-01 00:00:00 UTC"\
        ]\
      ]\
\
    }\
  ]
}
```

### Report submitted per quarter by severity

Now let's assume that you wanted the same data as the previous example, but you wanted them split by severity. Let's also assume that you only want the data for one specific program with id of 5. In order to do this you would make a very similar query, but use the "submissions-by-severity" key instead of the "submissions" key and add the team\_id=5 parameter.

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/analytics/?key=submissions-by-severity&start_at=2023-12-05&end_at=2024-12-05&interval=quarter&team_id=5" \
 -X GET \
 -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>" \
 -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

Which would return an [analytics object](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources#analytics) like this (abbreviated for legibility):

```
{
  "data":[\
    {\
      "keys":[\
        "none",\
        "low",\
        "medium",\
        "high",\
        "critical",\
        "no_severity",\
        "interval"\
      ],\
      "values":[\
        [\
          "0",\
          "8", # <- low severity count\
          "64", # <- medium severity count\
          "32", # <- high severity count\
          "32", # <- critical severity count\
          "0",\
          "2023-10-01 00:00:00 UTC"\
        ],\
        # [.. abbrev ..]\
        [\
          "0",\
          "8", # <- low severity count\
          "64", # <- medium severity count\
          "32", # <- high severity count\
          "32", # <- critical severity count\
          "0",\
          "2024-10-01 00:00:00 UTC"\
        ],\
      ]\
    }\
  ]
}
```

NOTE: If you are using the team\_id parameter and are getting data back that is all 0s, make sure that your API key has access to that team.

### Bounties awarded per month

If you wanted to retrieve the total amount awarded per month from September 2024 through December 2024 for an organization with id 3, you could make the following request

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/analytics/?key=bounty-awarded&start_at=2024-09-01&end_at=2024-12-31&interval=month&organization_id=3" \
 -X GET \
 -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>" \
 -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

Which would return an [analytics object](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources#analytics) like this:

```
{
  "data":
  [\
    {\
      "keys":[\
        "bounty_awarded",\
        "interval"\
      ],\
      "values":[\
        [\
          "123456.0",\
          "2024-09-01 00:00:00 UTC"\
        ],\
        [\
          "154986.0",\
          "2024-10-01 00:00:00 UTC"\
        ],\
        [\
          "234567.0",\
          "2024-11-01 00:00:00 UTC"\
        ],\
        [\
          "8000.0",\
          "2024-12-01 00:00:00 UTC"\
        ]\
      ]\
    }\
  ]
}
```

### SLA statistics

The statistics queries behave slightly differently. Since they return a single data point instead of an array of time sequenced data points, the "interval" parameter does not impact the results of the query. It is still a required parameter however.

Another note is that the keys for these queries use '\_' instead of '-' between words.

As an example of a statistics query, let's say you wanted to know how many reports missed their first response target from the 5th of December 2023 to the 5th of December 2024.

You could make the following query

```
curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/analytics/?key=sla_statistics&start_at=2023-12-05&end_at=2024-12-05&interval=quarter" \
 -X GET \
 -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>" \
 -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

Which would return an [analytics object](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources#analytics) like this:

```
{
  "data":[\
    {\
      "keys":[\
        "missed_first_response_target",\
        "average_first_response_time",\
        "median_first_response_time",\
        "missed_triage_target",\
        "average_triage_time",\
        "median_triage_time",\
        "missed_bounty_target",\
        "average_bounty_time",\
        "median_bounty_time",\
        "missed_resolution_target",\
        "average_resolution_time",\
        "median_resolution_time"\
      ],\
      "values":[\
        [\
          "2", # <- 2 reports missed their first response target\
          "880732.75",\
          "42120",\
          "2",\
          "26780.0",\
          "38220",\
          "1",\
          "2484288.0",\
          "3442591",\
          "2",\
          null,\
          "0"\
        ]\
      ]\
    }\
  ]
}
```

NOTE: Times are returned in seconds. Averages will be null if their denominator would be zero. In this example, no reports were resolved in the provided timeframe, so the average resolution time is returned as null.
