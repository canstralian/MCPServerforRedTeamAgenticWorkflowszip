# Getting Started

> API Endpoint

```
https://api.hackerone.com/
```

The HackerOne API can be used to query or update information about reports and your HackerOne program.

The API always returns a JSON response and implements [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) to access resources. The API can only be accessed over HTTPS and is compliant with the [JSON API specification](https://jsonapi.org/).

API tokens can be generated from your Program Settings if you’re already using the HackerOne Professional, Community, or Enterprise edition. If you can’t generate an API token, you can [contact sales](mailto:sales@hackerone.com) to upgrade your program or [create a test program](https://hackerone.com/teams/new/sandbox) to experiment with the API.

To get started with the HackerOne API:

1. [Generate an API Token](https://docs.hackerone.com/organizations/api-tokens.html).
2. Go to [Core Resources](https://api.hackerone.com/customer-resources) and choose the endpoint you want to pull information from.
3. Copy the curl command for the endpoint.
4. Paste the curl command in an editor.
5. Edit the curl code with your own information.
6. Paste the code into your terminal or the program you normally use to run the API call.

## API sandbox

HackerOne offers a sandbox for customers to help test API functionality. To
create a sandbox program, go [here](https://hackerone.com/teams/new/sandbox)
(make sure you're logged in to your HackerOne account. If you don't have an account
yet, you can create one [here](https://hackerone.com/users/sign_up)). You can
select any product edition, giving you access to almost all features HackerOne offers.

## Authentication

> cURL example

```
  curl "https://api.hackerone.com/v1/reports/129329" \
    -u "<YOUR_API_USERNAME>:<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"
```

> Replace the example credentials in the example above with your own.

HTTP Basic authentication is used to authenticate to the API. As an Admin User you can generate
and manage API Tokens from your organization's settings page. The API Token identifier and value
are used as the username and password for basic authentication and must be sent in the
Authorization header for every request.

If you set up an IP whitelist for your account and provide valid credentials, the server
will respond with a 403 Forbidden response. If an invalid token is provided, the server
will respond with a 401 Unauthorized response. See the [error codes](https://api.hackerone.com/getting-started/#error-codes) section
for more information how these errors are returned.

## Rate Limits

To ensure a pleasant platform experience for all our users, we have implemented several rate limits in our API. Customers who send too many requests may see an error show up with the status code: 429. We have the following rate limits in place:

- Read operations: 600 requests per minute (except for report pages: 300 requests/minute).
- Write operations: 25 requests per 20 seconds.

## Error Responses

| Error Code | Meaning | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | Bad Request | Request does not conform with the specification. Please see the endpoint's documentation for further instructions. |
| 401 | Unauthorized | The client sent a request without proper identification, or the username provided is incorrect. Please note that your username is not an email address. More information about this error can be found in the Authentication section. |
| 403 | Forbidden | The API token does not grant the client access to perform this action. This can happen in case where the client requests a resource that belongs to another program or account. |
| 404 | Not Found | The requested resource is not found. The client might be using outdated information to identify the resource. |
| 406 | Not Acceptable | This error is returned when the client requests our API to respond in a format that we haven't implemented yet. The current version of the API only supports responses to be returned when the client requests **application/javascript**. The good news is that most clients do this by default, so you shouldn't see this error very often. |
| 422 | Unprocessable Entity | The server understands the content type of the request entity, and the syntax of the request entity is correct, but it was unable to process the contained instructions. |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | The client sent too many requests, please review our [rate limits](https://api.hackerone.com/getting-started/#rate-limits) to make sure you're not sending more requests than the limit indicates. |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | This means that there's an error on our side. Our engineering team is notified of these errors, so we try to come up with a solution as soon as possible. If the error persists, please contact [https://support.hackerone.com/](https://support.hackerone.com/) |
| 503 | Service Unavailable | Seems like our servers are offline. You can check our server status at [www.hackeronestatus.com](https://www.hackeronestatus.com/). |

## Versioning

> URL structure

```
https://api.hackerone.com/{version}/{resource}
```

The entire API uses a global version. For every backwards-incompatible change, the
version is bumped. There is no default version, so the requested version must be
specified in the resource URL.

Introducing new attributes or resources are **not** considered backwards-incompatible
and can be added to the latest stable version at any time.
